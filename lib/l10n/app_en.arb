  "diagnosisRecklessBottom1": "Your weight setting doesn't match your current form. To prevent injury, I recommend lowering the weight and ensuring control at the bottom before trying again.",
  "diagnosisRecklessBottom2": "You might not be able to catch the weight. The shortcut is to find the limit where you can maintain correct form with lighter weight to promote neurological adaptation.",
  "diagnosisRecklessBottom3": "Excessive heavy weight leads to form breakdown. First, return to a weight you can handle and train to improve stability in the starting position.",
  "diagnosisRecklessMiddle1": "If you try to lift with momentum, it puts stress on your joints at the midpoint. Return to a controllable weight setting and focus on careful strokes.",
  "diagnosisRecklessMiddle2": "Control at this weight might be premature. Prioritize stabilizing the trajectory by lowering the weight, as the risk of injury increases.",
  "diagnosisRecklessMiddle3": "There is a fear that form cannot be maintained. Until you build basic strength, avoid challenging impossible weights and strive to learn the correct trajectory.",
  "diagnosisRecklessTop1": "It seems you lack the strength to push through to the finish. Forcing it may hurt your joints, so cultivate basic triceps strength with accessory exercises.",
  "diagnosisRecklessTop2": "If trunk instability is seen, it's a sign of overweight. First lower the weight and prioritize building a foundation that doesn't wobble at the finish.",
  "diagnosisRecklessTop3": "Have the courage to lower the weight if your form collapses even slightly. Completing with correct form is the shortest route to growth.",

  "diagnosisChallengeBottom1": "Initial output shortage is possible. To improve explosiveness, incorporating 'Pause Bench' with lighter weight is generally effective.",
  "diagnosisChallengeBottom2": "Be conscious of stretching the pectoralis major. Trying a slightly wider grip within a comfortable range of motion is also one way to strengthen the bottom.",
  "diagnosisChallengeBottom3": "You may not be using lower body power. Be conscious of firmly planting your feet when lowering the bar and improving whole-body coordination.",
  "diagnosisChallengeMiddle1": "Weakness in reversal might be the issue. Consider introducing 'Spoto Press', stopping a few centimeters above the chest, to strengthen the sticking point.",
  "diagnosisChallengeMiddle2": "Load transfer might not be smooth. It effective to intensively strengthen muscle output at the midpoint with limited range of motion exercises like 'Floor Press'.",
  "diagnosisChallengeMiddle3": "Bar acceleration may be insufficient. Try lifting with speed, keeping an image of pushing up all at once from bottom to top.",
  "diagnosisChallengeTop1": "Lockout reinforcement is necessary. I recommend adding 'Close Grip Bench' at the end of your set to intensively train triceps.",
  "diagnosisChallengeTop2": "Power might be escaping at the finish. Being conscious of pulling the bar outward helps tighten the armpits and increase stimulation to the triceps.",
  "diagnosisChallengeTop3": "As neurological reinforcement in the final phase, limited range of motion exercises like 'Board Press' may be effective. Try it in a safe environment.",

  "diagnosisCloseBottom1": "Review your setup. If scapular retraction is weak, the bottom becomes unstable. Reconfirm your back arch before rack up.",
  "diagnosisCloseBottom2": "Breathing timing might be off. Be conscious of applying abdominal pressure (bracing) firmly and solidifying your trunk before starting the movement.",
  "diagnosisCloseBottom3": "Mental influence is also possible. Don't be too conscious of clear heaviness, focus on lifting with your usual rhythm.",
  "diagnosisCloseMiddle1": "Force tends to disperse if elbows open. Correct the trajectory so elbows come directly under the bar by tightening armpits moderately.",
  "diagnosisCloseMiddle2": "Check if the bar trajectory is flowing towards your face. Always keep careful movement in mind, tracing a vertical or appropriate trajectory.",
  "diagnosisCloseMiddle3": "If your gaze wavers, your form wavers. Staring at one point on the ceiling and fixing your head position often increases lifting stability.",
  "diagnosisCloseTop1": "Bent wrists cause power loss. Reconfirm grip strength and angle with the image of placing the bar on the forearm bones.",
  "diagnosisCloseTop2": "Hold strong consciousness towards the finish. Don't relax until lift completion, image training of pushing through to the end is effective.",
  "diagnosisCloseTop3": "If hips float, power escapes and causes fouls or back pain. Capture the floor with whole soles and keep glutes attached to the bench.",

  "diagnosisStagnationBottom1": "Negative motion (lowering movement) might be sloppy. Keep consciousness of lowering with control while maintaining muscle tension.",
  "diagnosisStagnationBottom2": "Start position might be collapsing. Perform setup carefully every time and repeat so you can always start with the same form.",
  "diagnosisStagnationBottom3": "Lack of concentration is the source of injury. Before entering a set, regulate breathing and prepare to face the barbell.",
  "diagnosisStagnationMiddle1": "Habit of relying on recoil might be attached. Practicing with a 'pause' is also a good means to cultivate the sensation of lifting with muscle power.",
  "diagnosisStagnationMiddle2": "Check if shoulders are shrugged. Keeping shoulders down (depression) and chest up is indispensable for smooth lifting.",
  "diagnosisStagnationMiddle3": "Consciousness towards lifting speed might be fading. Don't lose to weight, recall the 'aggressive feeling' of pushing up proactively.",
  "diagnosisStagnationTop1": "Left-right balance difference might be influencing. Adjusting left-right difference with Dumbbell Press helps break stagnation.",
  "diagnosisStagnationTop2": "It might be stamina shortage to push through to the end. Perform triceps accessory exercises and raise basic endurance.",
  "diagnosisStagnationTop3": "Giving up might be too early. Believing 'it will lift' and continuing to put power until the end opens a neurological breakthrough.",

  "diagnosisSlumpBottom1": "Fatigue might be accumulating. Continuing forcibly risks injury, so call it a day early and get sufficient sleep and nutrition.",
  "diagnosisSlumpBottom2": "If you feel body heaviness, condition adjustment is insufficient. Perform warm-up carefully or adjust with light weight until condition returns.",
  "diagnosisSlumpBottom3": "If the nervous system is exhausted, heavy weight can be counterproductive. Consider courageous rest as part of training.",
  "diagnosisSlumpMiddle1": "Any joint discomfort? If there is pain, I strongly recommend stopping training immediately and seeking professional diagnosis.",
  "diagnosisSlumpMiddle2": "If form is collapsing, drop the weight significantly and return to form practice. Bad habits take time to fix.",
  "diagnosisSlumpMiddle3": "Everyone has days where they can't concentrate. It's a wise choice to stop or change the menu to refresh before getting injured.",
  "diagnosisSlumpTop1": "Might be a sign of overwork. Review recent training frequency and consider setting appropriate rest days.",
  "diagnosisSlumpTop2": "Mental stress might be influencing. Prioritize refresh and wait for a day when you can face the barbell in perfect condition.",
  "diagnosisSlumpTop3": "Power doesn't come out with energy shortage. Review lifestyle habits, like if pre-workout meal and hydration were appropriate."
